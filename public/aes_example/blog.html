    <h2>My Adventures with AES</h2>
    <div class="short-divider"></div>
    <h5>My experiences writing a ground-up implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard in Dart.</h5>
    <p class="text-column">
        The AES is a commonly used encryption standard which was adopted by the United States Government following a
        NIST competition.
        Its predecessor, DES or the Data Encryption Standard, had been shown to be vulnerable to several types of
        attacks and a complete
        crack of the DES cipher was considered imminent. The cipher which won the NIST competition to become the AES was
        the Rijndael cipher.
        Designed by two Belgian cryptographers, Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemen, the Rijndael cipher won out over fifteen
        serious competitors
        which also met the NIST requirements for entry. After being ratified by NIST it was accepted by the US
        Government in 2002 as a federal
        standard.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>A High-Level Overview</h3>
    <p class="text-column">
        AES works by applying a repetitive process to a block of 128 bits of data. This process allows the data to be
        diffused sufficiently far
        from its original state as well as encrypted multiple times using multiple keys (referred to as round keys in
        the cipher). Typically the
        process starts by obtaining 128, 192 or 256 bits of secure random data from an SPRNG which are used as the
        private key of the encryption.
        The key is then subjected to a process known as key expansion where the original key is used to generate 10, 12
        or 14 round keys depending
        on the length of the private key. Once these keys are derived the actual encryption begins.
    </p>
    <p class="text-column">
        First the private key is applied to the current block (I will go over what "applied" entails later), this
        comprises the complete first
        round of encryption. Next the block undergoes three processes to diffuse the data, 1) Substitute bytes, 2) Shift
        rows, 3) Mix columns;
        after these three processes complete the next round key is applied and the cycle begins again. This cycle occurs
        a total of 9, 11 or 13
        times depending on the key size. Finally, for the last round, the substitute bytes and shift rows steps occur
        before the final
        round key is applied. Note that the mix columns step is omitted in the final round. Once the first block of 128
        bits is encrypted subsequent
        blocks are encrypted the same way. If the total number of bits to be encrypted cannot be broken evenly into 128
        bit blocks the last block is
        padded with zeros.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Fundamental Mathematics in AES</h3>
    <h4>Bitwise XOR</h4>
    <p class="text-column">
        XOR is the logic gate that AES uses to apply round keys to pieces of data. XOR works well for this because each
        possible output is distributed
        evenly among the possible inputs. That is, an output of 1 and an output of 0 both have two distinct inputs that
        can produce them. If an AND gate
        or an OR gate were used an output of 0 or 1, depending on which was used, could be translated directly to
        the given inputs. An XOR truth
        table looks like this:
    </p>
    <pre class="code-block">
A_______B___|___C
0       0   |   0
0       1   |   1
1       0   |   1
1       1   |   0
    </pre>
    <p class="text-column">
        A bitwise XOR works by applying the XOR operator across each bit in two corresponding bit sets. For example,
        <span class="inline-code">010101</span> and <span class="inline-code">110011</span>
    <pre class="code-block">
010101
110011
______
100110
    </pre>
    </p>
    <h4>Galois Fields</h4>
    <p class="text-column">
        A finite field (also known as a Galois field) is a field that contains a finite number of elements. Essentially
        it is a series of
        integers starting at 0 and ending at i - 1 where i is the length of the field. The finite field is maintained by
        defining numeric operations eg.
        addition and multiplication such that any operation applied to members of the field will produce another number
        in the field. For example in
        <span class="inline-code">Gf(5)</span> (denoting the field <span class="inline-code">{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}</span>),
        <span class="inline-code">1
            + 2 = 3</span>, but <span class="inline-code">1 + 4 = 0</span>. This type
        of operation should
        be familiar
        to anyone with experience
        using the modulus operator. Indeed, for any prime limit eg <span class="inline-code">Gf(3) Gf(13) Gf(19)</span>
        addition and multiplication
        can be defined as <span class="inline-code">c = (a + b) % i</span>
        and <span class="inline-code">c = (a * b) % i</span> where <span class="inline-code">i</span> is the limit of
        the Galois field.
    </p>
    <p class="text-column">
        Addition and multiplication in prime Galois fields are simple enough, but what about <span
            class="inline-code">Gf(6)</span> or <span class="inline-code">Gf(8)</span>? As it turns
        out one of these will work but
        the other will not; some numbers cannot be chosen as the limit of a finite field without breaking the
        constraints on arithmetic operations.
        The number chosen must be either a prime, or a prime power. A prime power is a number of the form <span
            class="inline-code">p^k</span> where <span class="inline-code">k</span> is
        an arbitrary exponent and <span class="inline-code">p</span>
        is an arbitrary prime number. If these constraints are followed a Galois field can be constructed,
        albeit with different rules involving
        multiplication and addition.
    </p>
    <p class="text-column">
        It is helpful to understand the representation of numbers in a base 2 Galois field as polynomials with
        coefficients in <span class="inline-code">Gf(2)</span>. Remember
        that <span class="inline-code">Gf(2) = {0, 1}</span>, so the possible coefficients in our polynomial are
        <span class="inline-code">{0, 1}</span>. This lets us represent
        any number in any Galois field
        <span class="inline-code">Gf(2^k)</span> as a polynomial where the coefficient is the binary digit occupying
        that space. For example the following are all equivalent:
    <pre class="code-block">
41

00101001

0x^7 + 0x^6 + 1x^5 + 0x^4 + 1x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x^1 + 1x^0

x^5 + x^3 + 1
</pre>
    This representation may seem convoluted, but it is necessary to preform addition and multiplication
    in a prime power Galois field.
    </p>
    <p class="text-column">
        Addition is done by adding two numbers (represented as polynomials) from <span
            class="inline-code">Gf(p^k)</span> in <span class="inline-code">Gf(p)</span>. For example
        <span class="inline-code">41 + 10</span> in <span class="inline-code">Gf(256)</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="code-block">
10 = 1010 = 1x^3 + 0x^2 + 1x^1 + 0x^2 = (x^3 + x)

41 = 101001 = 1x^5 + 0x^4 + 1x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x^1 + 1x^0 = (x^5 + x^3 + 1)

(x^5 + x^3 + 1) + (x^3 + x)

x^5 + x + 1 = 100011 = 35
</pre>
    <p class="text-column">
        Remember, our possible coefficients come from <span class="inline-code">Gf(2)</span> so <span
            class="inline-code">1 + 1 = 0</span>; this is the
        reason that <span class="inline-code">x^3 + x^3 = 0</span>.
        This is more easily understood in its binary representation <span class="inline-code">1010 + 101001</span> where
        addition is actually a
        bitwise XOR operation. The XOR trick only works for Galois fields of base 2 or having a characteristic of 2.
        Lucky for us AES uses <span class="inline-code">Gf(256)</span> for its operations so the XOR trick is
        applicable.
    </p>
    <p class="text-column">
        Multiplication is more complex than addition and is done by standard polynomial multiplication followed by
        modular division via some irreducible polynomial which
        was used define the finite field. Sounds hard right? It's not too bad if taken one step at a time with an
        example, so, for example: <span class="inline-code">12 * 7</span> in <span class="inline-code">Gf(2^8)</span>.
    </p>
    <pre class="code-block">
12 = x^3 + x^2

7 = x^2 + x + 1

p = (12 * 7)

p = (x^3 + x^2) * (x^2 + x + 1)

p = (x^5 + x^4 + x^3) + (x^4 + x^3 + x^2).
</pre>
    <p class="text-column">
        <br>So far we have just done simple polynomial multiplication; in the next step, consolidating the terms,
        addition is done like described above, in <span class="inline-code">Gf(2)</span>. Therefore
        our polynomial product is <span class="inline-code">p = x^5 + x^2 = 36</span>.
        <br>Since this does not exceed the limit of our our field, 256, the final step of reducing modulo some
        irreducible polynomial is not necessary and our final product is 36. It is worth noting that with the reducing
        polynomial for AES <span class="inline-code">x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1</span>, applying the
        modulus operation would still result in 36 being the final answer. If you want to see an example involving
        modulo reduction please look
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field_arithmetic">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="text-column">
        For practical application in AES multiplication is usually done via lookup in a table of values rather than a
        computational process (unless
        the implementation is built in a context with very low memory availability). The lookup method requires 256
        bytes of total memory space. In addition,
        Galois multiplication in 2^8 (the field size used in AES) can be done very efficiently using a modified version
        of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field_arithmetic">Peasant's Algorithm</a>. Included here is a dart
        function which implements that
        algorithm.
    </p>
    <pre class="code-block">
int galoisMultiplication(int a, int b) {
    int p = 0;
    int highBitSet;
    for (var i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
        if ((b & 1) == 1) {
        p ^= a;
        }
        highBitSet = (a & 0x80);
        a <<= 1;
        if (highBitSet == 0x80) {
        a ^= 0x1b;
        }
        b >>= 1;
    }

    // Convert back to unsigned 8 bit int
    return p % this._fieldLimit;

    </pre>
    <h3>Sbox Generation</h3>
    <p class="text-column">
        A key piece of Rijndael ciphers is the byte substitution box. At each encryption step, excluding the first
        round, and during key expansion the
        byte substitution box, or Sbox, is used to exchange one byte (eight bits) for another. The Rijndael algorithm
        does not use a dynamically generated
        Sbox, but rather has a well defined method for generating the same Sbox each time. The Sbox is arranged so that
        a particular byte can be located
        with its 4 most significant bits (largest bits) determining the column and its 4 least significant bits
        determining the row. The procedure for
        generating the Sbox can be broken into two distinct steps, first each number from 0 - 255 has its multiplicative
        inverse calculated in Gf(2^8),
        second each of the multiplicative inverses has an operation known as the Affine Transform applied to it. Lets go
        over this in depth with some
        examples.
    </p>
    <p class="text-column">
        Previously I mentioned that multiplication in a Galois field is typically done via lookup tables rather than a
        multiplication function. That method
        is especially applicable to inverse multiplication in finite fields. Calculating the multiplicative inverse of a
        number in a finite field requires
        access to log and anti-log (exponent) tables in the same finite field. Once these tables are constructed the
        multiplicative inverse can be found
        using the formula anti-log(255 - log(x)). This formula works for all numbers excepting zero which must be
        handled as a special case; for AES
        purposes the inverse of zero is assumed to be zero even though this breaks ordinary mathematic rules.
    </p>
    <p class="text-column">
        Calculating log and anti-log tables for taking the multiplicative inverse of a number requires the use of
        exponentiation in a finite field. It
        turns out that certain numbers in the range 0 - i where i is the Galois field limit will generate all possible
        numbers in the field if repeatedly
        exponentiated using Galois multiplication. Those numbers are referred to as field generators and work like this,
        <br>g = the generator number
        <br>g*1 = a
        <br>g*a = b
        <br>g*b = c
        <br>g*d = e
        <br>Eventually if the above process is repeated i times all possible numbers in the set will have been visited.
        By storing these numbers as they
        are generated in a loop we can produce a lookup table which will tell us the result of some exponent or
        logarithm of x. Below is some dart code
        demonstrating the process of generating these tables.

    <pre class="code-block">
void _populateLogAndAntilog() {
    int product = 1;

    for (var i = 0; i < this._fieldLimit; i++) {
        _logTable[product] = i;
        _antiLogTable[i] = product;
        product = this.galoisMultiplication(_generator, product);
    }
}

void _fillSboxWithMultiplicativeInverse() {
    // We skip i = 0 here because 0 is a special case.
    // We define the multiplicative inverse of zero to be zero.
    for (var i = 1; i < this._fieldLimit; i++) {

        After filling the Sbox with multiplicative inverses in Gf(256) the next step is to compute the Affine transform
        for each value. The Affine transform can be defined
        as the sum (calculated as a bitwise XOR) of the original number, four subsequent circular left rotations of the
        number, and the vector
        constant (01100011 in binary, 63 in hexadecimal). To demonstrate more clearly let's examine an example with the
        number 8d:
    </p>
    <pre class="code-block">
8d = 10001101

1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 +
0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 +

    </pre>
    <p class="text-column">
        So, in other words, with an input of 8d we should expect to get an output of 77. This process is repeated for
        each multiplicative inverse
        previously calculated and, when finished, produces the entire Rijndael Sbox. The following is a dart function
        which applies the Affine
        transform to each 8 bit multiplicative inverse in a loop.

        That completes my explanation of the Sbox generation process and the math involved in its construction. It
        should be noted that in practical

    <h3>Key Expansion</h3>
    <p class="text-column">
        We've managed to make it quite far into an encryption algorithm without discussing the key details at all, so
        lets start with some definitions.
        Keys in AES can be 128, 192 or 256 bits. For simplicities sake I will only discuss the expansion of a 128 bit
        key, if you wish to learn about the
        differences in each key expansion I suggest looking <a href="https://www.samiam.org/key-schedule.html">here</a>.
        AES / Rijndael keys are composed
        of "words". Each word is 4 bytes or 16 bits of data; since Rijndael operates on bytes instead of bits we will
        define a word as 4 bytes. It follows
        that a 128 bit key is composed of 16 bytes, or, by our previous definition, 4 words. The key expansion must
        produce a total of 11 keys including the
        original randomly generated key. Each round of key expansion creates a new key from the key created in the
        previous round.
    </p>
    <p class="text-column">
        The algorithm for generating each word in a new round key is very simple for words 2, 3 and 4; it requires that
        the corresponding word from the
        previous round be XOR'ed with the last word created to produce the next word. For example if we are creating
        word 2 of the second round key it
        would be equal to word 1 of the second round key XOR'ed with word 2 of the first round key. This pattern holds
        true for words 3 and 4 of the round
        key as well.
    </p>
    <p class="text-column">
        Word 1 of each key is more complicated, it still uses the last word created and its corresponding word from the
        previous round, but before the
        XOR operation is applied an additional function is applied to the last word created. This operation is referred
        to as the schedule_core function
        or as the rcon function (rcon stands for round constant). This function has three steps, first circularly rotate
        the word one byte to the left,
        second apply the Sbox to all four bytes (substitute each byte in the box for its corresponding Sbox byte), third
        XOR the word with the round
        constant. The round constant is a word as well and it begins as {0x01, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0}; however, each time the
        round constant is used it is
        multiplied by 0x02 in Gf(256) after being applied to the word. Once the schedule_core function is run the
        produced word is then XOR'ed with the
        first word of the previous round and the resulting word becomes the first word of the current round.
    </p>
    <p class="text-column">
        This key expansion routine was very confusing to me at first despite being relatively simple (in my opinion)
        compared to Galois field arithmetic.
        To make things clearer lets do an example key expansion:

af 78 92 1a
4c e5 12 6a
7c ac ef d2

{01, 00, 00, 00}

Key 1 Word 1
Four Words Ago = 01 af 4c 7c
Previous Word = 03 1a 6a d2
Left Shift Previous Word = 1a 6a d2 03
Apply Sbox to Word = a2 02 b5 7b
XOR Word With Rcon = a3 02 b5 7b
XOR Word With Four Words Ago = a2 ad f9 07
Result: a2 ad f9 07

    <h3>Add Round Key</h3>
    <p class="text-column">
        We have discussed AES arithmetic, Sbox generation and key expansion; we now have all the tools necessary to dive
        into the AES encryption algorithm.
        Before we start a few notes, first as in previous examples I will only be working with a 128 bit key though I
        will try to explain how 192 and 256
        bit keys are applied as well for completeness. Second, the next four sections will be using a shared example
        with each section picking up where the
        previous one left off. The key used for this example will be the same as the example key in the key expansion
        section. Finally, I will include in
        a separate page a complete example containing a full key expansion and one full round of AES encryption over 128
        bytes of data. The data we will be
        encrypting is below:

    <p class="text-column">
        Applying a round key to a block of data is probably the simplest operation that AES performs during the
        encryption rounds. It consists entirely
        of Xoring the given data block with the current round key. For example with our first round key:

        Its easy to see how this process works with 128 bits of data and 128 bits of key, but what about the 192 and 256
        bit keys that AES also supports?
        The block size for data is fixed at 128, so how can a 192 bit key be applied to 128 bits of data? The answer is
        that once the 192 or 256 bit key
        is expanded, producing 192 or 256 additional key bits for each round of expansion, the full bit sequence is
        split into 128 bit chunks which are
        applied to the data one by one. So even though a 192 bit key is expanded to 12 "keys", the full bit sequence is
        enough for 18 total round keys.
        The same goes for a 256 bit key which is expanded to 14 "keys" for a total of 28 rounds of key application.
    </p>
    <h3>Substitute Bytes</h3>
    <p class="text-column">
        Once the data has been XOR'ed against the round key each byte is substituted for its Sbox companion. Sbox
        lookups are done by splitting the byte
        into two nybbles (a nybble denotes a collection of four bits). The high nybble determines the row and the low
        nybble the column. The completed
        Sbox from the Sbox generation section can be used to find these bits. Interestingly, if the Sbox is rearranged
        so that each row is appended to the
        end of the row preceding it, lookups can be done by converting the byte into an integer index. This works
        because each row is 16 columns long, so
        a base 16 number will map directly to its corresponding array index.

    <h3>Mix Columns</h3>
    <p class="text-column">
        The mix columns operation is the final operation in a round of encryption. This operation takes place the fewest
        times as it is omitted in both
        the first and final rounds. It is essentially a matrix multiplication in Gf(256); this makes it different from
        ordinary matrix multiplication. All
        arithmetic operations take place in the finite field rather than in ordinary integer space. Matrices can only be
        multiplied if their dimensions
        are compatible. In order to both match these constraints and to maximize diffusion during this step each
        4x4 block of bytes is multiplied
        by a 4x4 matrix:
